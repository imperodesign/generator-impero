> 

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-impero using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
npm i -g yo generator-impero
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo impero
```

## Help

If you have any immediate issues, the first port of call is Yeoman Doctor:

```bash
yo doctor
```

Failing that, it's also possible that you'll need to open a new terminal window for Yeoman to pick up on the newly installed generator

## Getting To Know Yeoman

This project is based upon the generator-generator generator (generator-ception)
